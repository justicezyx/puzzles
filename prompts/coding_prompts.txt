and provide a high level overview of the solution.

"""
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the largest body of water.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [
["1","1","1","1","0"],
["1","1","0","1","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["1","1","1","1","1"]
]

Output: 6
